# Model 1 Challenge

## Refactoring code

### Description

In this challenge, I have refactored the code of Horiseon's landing page made by Xandromus.

https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram

I have also added comments in order for the code to be more easily.

This webpage is for Horiseon, who specializes in search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. Since this company is made to boost online presence, it is important to showcase their content in a way that is optimal for users to find and navigate all while maintaining the same look of the original.

### Screenshot 

Here is how Horiseon's page looks like after the changes in code were implimented.

As you can see, it still looks identical to the original but with more efficient code.
